OpenPnP is an Open Source SMT pick and place system that includes ready to run software, and hardware designs that you can build and modify. You can also use OpenPnP software to run a pick and place machine of your own design, or with existing commercial machines, giving them abilities they never had with their OEM software.

To get started with OpenPnP, read through the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Quick-Start). This short guide will help you download and install the software, run through a sample job and take you to the next step of building or configuring your hardware.

If you’d like some ideas on how to build your own machine, check out the [Hardware](/hardware) section for free, Open Source, designs that you can build yourself.
