OpenPnP is an Open Source SMT pick and place system that includes ready to run software, and hardware designs that you can build and modify. You can also use OpenPnP software to run a pick and place machine of your own design, or with existing commercial machines, giving them abilities they never had with their OEM software.

If you’d like some ideas on how to build your own machine, check out the [Hardware](/hardware) section for free, Open Source, designs that you can build yourself.
